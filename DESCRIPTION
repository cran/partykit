Description: A toolkit with infrastructure for representing, summarizing, and
  visualizing tree-structured regression and classification models. This
  unified infrastructure can be used for reading/coercing tree models from
  different sources ('rpart', 'RWeka', 'PMML') yielding objects that share
  functionality for print()/plot()/predict() methods. Furthermore, new and improved
  reimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and model-based
  recursive partitioning (mob()) from the 'party' package are provided based
  on the new infrastructure. A description of this package was published
  by Hothorn and Zeileis (2015) <http://jmlr.org/papers/v16/hothorn15a.html>.
